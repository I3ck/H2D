add tests for everything

rename to H2D instead of H2d

path is missing many methods

path made of line segments

sweep intersections

define path as line segments or

use classes like Moveable which define a move method, then derive from them

instanciate show and read instead of parse and write

fromIntegral realToFrac

drop angle as parameter from ellipse?

add interpolations

add all path algorithms

test for all the algorithms

many functions dont check for empty lists or lists with 1 element

add sweep intersection algorithms

missing:
    min/max x/y
    bounding box
    make unique
    average distance
    has point
    remove above/below/rightof/leftof
    remove closer/further to
    center
    closest/furthest to path/point
    similar/equal
    intersections intersects
    sortX sortY (sort already done)

make this a proper package useable by others

add a license

release on github?
