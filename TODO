add tests for everything

path is missing many methods

path made of line segments

sweep intersections

define path as line segments or

use classes like Moveable which define a move method, then derive from them

instanciate show and read instead of parse and write

fromIntegral realToFrac

drop angle as parameter from ellipse?

add interpolations

add all path algorithms

add sweep intersection algorithms

make this a proper package useable by others

add a license

release on github?
