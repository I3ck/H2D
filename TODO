add tests for everything

instanciate show and read instead of parse and write

fromIntegral realToFrac

drop angle as parameter from ellipse?

many functions dont check for empty lists or lists with 1 element

missing:
    make unique
    remove closer/further to
    closest/furthest to path/point
    similar/equal
    intersections intersects intersection code https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line%E2%80%93line_intersection or sweep intersections
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer%E2%80%93Douglas%E2%80%93Peucker_algorithm
    interpolations

make this a proper package useable by others
